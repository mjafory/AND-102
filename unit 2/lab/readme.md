# RecyclerView Lab | AND 102: Intermediate Android Development | CodePath Unit 2 Lab

A simple counter app developed in Kotlin that tracks the number of times a user taps on a button. The app is designed to mimic the mechanics of popular idle tap mobile games.


## Overview

This lab focuses on building a RecyclerView in Android to display a list of emails. By the end of this lab, you will learn how to customize the UI for each item in the RecyclerView and implement additional features such as scrolling through emails and displaying sender pictures.
