# Android Project 3 - *Flixster*

Submitted by: **Magfur Jafory**

**Flixster** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse movies currently playing in theaters.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [x] **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [x] **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [x] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [x] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading
  - Note: this feature is difficult to capture in a GIF without throttling internet speeds.  Instead, include an additional screencap of your Glide code implementing the feature.  (<10 lines of code)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! 
  - Added log
  - Wishlist Button
