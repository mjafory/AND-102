# Android App Development Course

## Overview

 I joined to the Android App Development Course at CodePath Feb 2024! This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Android development using Kotlin and Android Studio. Below is an overview of the course structure, unit topics, and individual/group projects.

## Unit Structure

Each unit comprises 2 hours of in-class time, consisting of an interactive lesson and hands-on labs. Additionally, I will work on unit projects, ranging from individual app specifications to group projects in units 7-10. The estimated time for unit projects is 2-4 hours per unit, and they are asynchronous.

## Individual App Projects

Each unit, I  will build an Android app to apply the concepts learned. The apps will take approximately 5-10 hours outside of class session times to complete.

## Labs

In labs, students will be guided through building apps to introduce new concepts in a hands-on environment. Labs include:

- **Idle Tap Game:** An app that counts the times a user taps on the screen.
- **Gmail Clone:** An app simulating a client for browsing a list of emails.
- **NY Times Lab Series:** A series of labs using the NY Times API to build out a functional book and article browsing app.
